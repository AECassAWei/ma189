# Comparing More Than Two Populations

- We have learned how to test if one population mean vector equals a specific vector
\[
 H_0: \underline{\mu}^{(1)} = \underline{\mu}_0 \quad H_a: \underline{\mu}^{(1)} \neq \underline{\mu}_0.
\]
- Also, we have learned how to test if two populations have equal mean vectors
\[
 H_0: \underline{\mu}^{(1)} = \underline{\mu}^{(2)} \quad H_a: \underline{\mu}^{(1)} \neq \underline{\mu}^{(2)}.
\]
- What if we want to test the equivalence of mean vectors among three or more populations?
- Suppose $\underline{\mu}^{(1)}, \ldots, \underline{\mu}^{(g)}$  are mean vectors of $g$ populations. We are interested in testing
\[
 H_0: \underline{\mu}^{(1)} = \ldots = \underline{\mu}^{(g)} 
 \quad H_a: \underline{\mu}^{(i)} \neq \underline{\mu}^{(j)} \; \mbox{for some} \, i \neq j.
\]
- The null hypothesis assumes all mean vectors to be the same. The null hypothesis is false
(alternative is true) if any two mean vectors are different.

## Example: Romano-British Pottery Data

- Romano-British Pottery shards are collected from four sites in the British Isles:

1. L: Llanedeyrn
2. C: Caldicot
3. I: Isle Thorns
4. A: Ashley Rails

- Each pottery sample was returned to the laboratory for a chemical test. In these tests the concentrations of five different chemicals were measured:

1. Al: Aluminum
2. Fe: Iron
3. Mg: Magnesium
4. Ca: Calcium
5. Na: Sodium

- Does the chemical content of the pottery depend on the site where the pottery was discovered?
If yes, we can use the chemical content of a pottery sample of unknown origin to determine which site the sample came from.

## A Peek at the Data

Adopted from: Tubb, A., A. J. Parker, and G. Nickless. 1980. "The Analysis of Romano-British Pottery by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry". *Archaeometry* 22: 153-71.

```{r}
pottery <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\neide\\Documents\\GitHub\\ma189\\Data\\RBPottery.csv")
colnames(pottery) <- c("No", "ID", "Kiln", "Al", "Fe", "Mg", "Ca", "Na", "K2O", "TiO2", "MnO", "BaO")
pot_llan <- pottery[pottery$Kiln==2,]
pot_cald <- pottery[pottery$Kiln==3,]
pot_is <- pottery[pottery$Kiln==4,]
pot_ar <- pottery[pottery$Kiln==5,]
pottery[c(23,37,39,44),4:8]
```

Dataset contains $26$ ancient pottery shards found at four sites in British Isles. For each of $26$ samples of pottery, the percentages of oxides of five metals are measured.
 
# Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)

- ANalysis Of VAriance (ANOVA) is a set of statistical tools used to analyze the differences
among population means given their samples. *ANOVA* is useful for comparing (testing) three or
more group means for statistical significance.
- ANOVA was developed by British statistician Ronald Fisher.
- ANOVA is conceptually similar to multiple two-sample tests, but is more conservative (fewer
type I errors). It is suited to a wide range of practical problems.

## Univariate ANOVA

- We begin with the univariate case. Suppose we have $g$ treatments (samples). For the $k$th treatment, we observe its effects on a group of patients of size $n_k$. The dataset
can be summarized in the following table.
\[
 \left[ \begin{array}{ccccc}   & 1 & 2 & \ldots & g \\
    1 & x_{11} & x_{12} & \ldots & x_{1g} \\
    2 & x_{21} & x_{22} & \ldots & x_{2g} \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
    n_k & x_{n_1,1} & x_{n_2,1} & \ldots & x_{n_g, g} 
\end{array}  \right]
\]


### Notation:

- $x_{ik}$ is $i$th observation in $k$th sample
- $n_k$ is number of observations in $k$th sample
- $N = n_1 + \ldots + n_g$ is total sample size
- $g$ is the  number of treatments/populations/samples

### Assumptions for the ANOVA:

1. The data from group $k$ has common mean $\mu_k$, i.e., ${\mathbb E} [ x_{ik} ] = \mu_k$.
2. *Homoskedasticity*: the data from all groups have common variance $\sigma^2$.
3. Independence: the observations are independently sampled.
4. Normality: the data are normally distributed.

The hypothesis of interest is that all of the means are equal. Mathematically this is formulated as:
\[
 H_0: \ {\mu}^{(1)} = \ldots = \ {\mu}^{(g)} 
 \quad H_a: \ {\mu}^{(i)} \neq \ {\mu}^{(j)} \; \mbox{for some} \, i \neq j.
\]
- The alternative hypothesis indicates there exists at least one pair of different
group population means.

## Total Sum of Squares

- Consider the following notation:
\[
 \overline{x}_k = \frac{1}{n_k} \sum_{i=1}^{n_k} x_{ik}, 
\]
 the sample mean of the $k$th sample.
\[
 \overline{x} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=1}^g \sum_{i=1}^{n_k} x_{ik}, 
\] 
the grand mean (or, the overall sample mean).
- The Analysis of Variance involves a partitioning of the total sum of squares, defined as:
\[
 \mbox{SS}_{total} = \sum_{k=1}^g \sum_{i=1}^{n_k} {( x_{ik} - \overline{x} )}^2.
 \]
- $\mbox{SS}_{total}$ is the sum of squared differences between each observation and the
grand mean, which measures variation of the data around the grand mean.
- When observations are far away from the grand mean, it tends to take a large value.
- When observations are close to the grand mean, it tends to take a small value.

## Partitioning Total Sum of Squares

- An Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is a partitioning of the total sum of squares.
\begin{align}
  \mbox{SS}_{total} & = \sum_{k=1}^g \sum_{i=1}^{n_k} {( x_{ik} - \overline{x} )}^2 \\
& =  \sum_{k=1}^g \sum_{i=1}^{n_k} {[ ( x_{ik} - \overline{x}_k ) - (\overline{x}_k - \overline{x} ) ]}^2 \\
 & = \sum_{k=1}^g \sum_{i=1}^{n_k} { ( x_{ik} - \overline{x}_k )}^2 +
  n_k \sum_{k=1}^g  {  (\overline{x}_k - \overline{x} )  }^2.
\end{align}
- The first term is called the *error sum of squares* and measures the variation in the data
about their group means. Denoted as $\mbox{SS}_{error}$.
- The second term is called the *treatment sum of squares* and involves the differences
between the group means and the Grand mean. Denoted as  $\mbox{SS}_{treat}$.
