# Comparing More Than Two Populations

- We have learned how to test if one population mean vector equals a specific vector
\[
 H_0: \underline{\mu}^{(1)} = \underline{\mu}_0 \quad H_a: \underline{\mu}^{(1)} \neq \underline{\mu}_0.
\]
- Also, we have learned how to test if two populations have equal mean vectors
\[
 H_0: \underline{\mu}^{(1)} = \underline{\mu}^{(2)} \quad H_a: \underline{\mu}^{(1)} \neq \underline{\mu}^{(2)}.
\]
- What if we want to test the equivalence of mean vectors among three or more populations?
- Suppose $\underline{\mu}^{(1)}, \ldots, \underline{\mu}^{(g)}$  are mean vectors of $g$ populations. We are interested in testing
\[
 H_0: \underline{\mu}^{(1)} = \ldots = \underline{\mu}^{(g)} 
 \quad H_a: \underline{\mu}^{(i)} \neq \underline{\mu}^{(j)} \; \mbox{for some} \, i \neq j.
\]
- The null hypothesis assumes all mean vectors to be the same. The null hypothesis is false
(alternative is true) if any two mean vectors are different.

## Example: Romano-British Pottery Data

- Romano-British Pottery shards are collected from four sites in the British Isles:

1. L: Llanedeyrn
2. C: Caldicot
3. I: Isle Thorns
4. A: Ashley Rails

- Each pottery sample was returned to the laboratory for a chemical test. In these tests the concentrations of five different chemicals were measured:

1. Al: Aluminum
2. Fe: Iron
3. Mg: Magnesium
4. Ca: Calcium
5. Na: Sodium

- Does the chemical content of the pottery depend on the site where the pottery was discovered?
If yes, we can use the chemical content of a pottery sample of unknown origin to determine which site the sample came from.

## A Peek at the Data

Adopted from: Tubb, A., A. J. Parker, and G. Nickless. 1980. "The Analysis of Romano-British Pottery by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry". *Archaeometry* 22: 153-71.

```{r}
pottery <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\neide\\Documents\\GitHub\\ma189\\Data\\RBPottery.csv")
colnames(pottery) <- c("No", "ID", "Kiln", "Al", "Fe", "Mg", "Ca", "Na", "K2O", "TiO2", "MnO", "BaO")
pot_llan <- pottery[pottery$Kiln==2,]
pot_cald <- pottery[pottery$Kiln==3,]
pot_is <- pottery[pottery$Kiln==4,]
pot_ar <- pottery[pottery$Kiln==5,]
pottery[c(23,37,39,44),4:8]
```

Dataset contains $26$ ancient pottery shards found at four sites in British Isles. For each of $26$ samples of pottery, the percentages of oxides of five metals are measured.
 
# Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)

- ANalysis Of VAriance (ANOVA) is a set of statistical tools used to analyze the differences
among population means given their samples. *ANOVA* is useful for comparing (testing) three or
more group means for statistical significance.
- ANOVA was developed by British statistician Ronald Fisher.
- ANOVA is conceptually similar to multiple two-sample tests, but is more conservative (fewer
type I errors). It is suited to a wide range of practical problems.

## Univariate ANOVA

- We begin with the univariate case. Suppose we have $g$ treatments (samples). For the $k$th treatment, we observe its effects on a group of patients of size $n_k$. The dataset
can be summarized in the following table.


1 2 ⋯ g
1 &'' &(' ⋯ &)'
2 &'( &(( ⋯ &)(
⋮ ⋮ ⋮ ⋱ ⋮
#$ &',- &(,. ⋯ &),/
Treatments (samples)
Observations
Notations:
• &$0 = 2-th observation in sample ".
• #$ = number of observations in sample ".
• 3 = #' + ⋯+ #) = total sample size.
• ! = number of treatments/populations/samples
