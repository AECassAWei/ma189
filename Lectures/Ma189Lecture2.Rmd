# Maternal Smoking and Infant Death
 
## Introduction

### Exploratory Data Analysis
First examine your data.

1. Catch mistakes in how data was entered
2. Discern patterns in the data
3. Check model assumptions
4. Generate working hypotheses

### Infant Death Tied to Premature Births
 
Surgeon General warning:

*'Smoking by pregnant women may result in fetal injury, premature birth and
low birth weight.'*

**Objective**: Evaluate the surgeon general warning by comparing the birth weights of
babies born to smokers and to non-smokers.

**Primary Data**: From the Child Health and Development Studies (CHDS).  Data is
collected for pregnancies that occurred between 1960 and 1967 among women in
Kaiser Health Plan of the San Francisco region.

**Notes**: This data is known for its unexpected finding that ounce for ounce babies of
smokers did not have a higher death rate than the babies of nonsmokers. Despite the surgeon general working: 15% of pregnant women smoke during pregnancy (study performed in 1996).


### Prior Knowledge

Epidemiological studies indicate that smoking is responsible for 150g of reduction in birth weight.

Epidemiological studies indicate that smoking mothers are twice as likely as non-smoking mothers to have a low-birth-weight baby (under 2500g).

Baby maturity is measured by **birth weight** and **babyâ€™s gestational age**.

Babies both early and born small have lower survival rates.


## Data

### Paradata (Facts About the Data)

Data collected for our study is enlarged portion of the mentioned CHDS data.

The data consists of all pregnancies that occurred between 1960 and 1967 among women in Kaiser Health Plan in Oakland, California.

The women in the study are all those that:

1. Were enrolled in Kaiser Heath Plan
2. Had obtained prenatal care in San Francisco area
3. Were delivered in any of the Kaiser hospitals in Northen California

At birth measurements are obtained: **length**, **weight**, and **head circumference**.

Our study is comprised of 1236 babies:

1. All the same gender: boys
2. Single births (no twins)
3. All lived at least 28 days
