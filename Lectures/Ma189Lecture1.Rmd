## Syllabus
Instructor goes through syllabus.

## What is R?
R is a computer language for doing statistical analysis. It is command-line style, so no compilation is needed before running (unlike C, Fortran, etc.). R is free, and you should install it on your PC. Your TA (as well as the instructor) can help with R; also see this tutorials: *An Introduction to R*. https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf

## What is RStudio?
RStudio is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment), which allows you to write and execute R code, participate in projects, view output, and more. This is free; please download and install.

## What is Python?
Python is also a command-line style language, and can be downloaded for free. For production-quality code, it is superior to R. PyCharm is a Python IDE. The class will be taught in R.

## What is R Markdown?
Markdown is a *plain text formatting syntax*.  You will use this to generate reports for your group homeworks and final project.  R Markdown extends Markdown by embedding R code.

## What is GitHub?
Course material will be on https://github.com/tuckermcelroy/ma189. This is a *repository* where you can view files (like Markdown files and data sets) and download them to your PC. Click *Raw* to view underyling R Markdown source file.

## First Tasks
Install R and RStudio, and get familiar with accessing files on GitHub. Review the background reading:

1. Writing Data Analysis Reports: *WritingReports.md* 
2. Some slides by Jonathan Taylor at Stanford Statistics Department, giving a constrast of *Statistics* and *Data Science*.
